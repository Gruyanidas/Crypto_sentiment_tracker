1. Data Collection
1.1 Price Data

    Choice of API: Use a well-known API such as CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko.

    API Setup: Obtain an API key if necessary (e.g., CoinMarketCap requires an API key). Test basic endpoints to confirm you can retrieve the required data (current price, 24-hour volume, market capitalization, etc.).

    Data Fields: At a minimum, fetch:

        Symbol (e.g., BTC, ETH)

        Current price

        24h price change percentage

        Market cap

        Trading volume

    Schedule/Frequency: Decide how often you will fetch the data (e.g., every hour or every minute). Store it in a local database or CSV so you can analyze historical trends.

1.2 Sentiment Data (Web Scraping)

    Target Platforms: Select your sources of social sentiment:

        Crypto news websites (e.g., CoinDesk)

        Reddit (subreddits like r/CryptoCurrency, r/Bitcoin, r/Ethereum)

        Twitter (if you want real-time chatter—though you’d need Twitter API or a scraping approach)

    Scraping Tools:

        Selenium: Automates opening a browser, logging in (if needed), or scrolling through infinite pages.

        BeautifulSoup: Parses the HTML to extract relevant post/comment text.

    Data Fields:

        Post/comment text

        Post date/time

        Author (optional, if relevant)

        Upvotes/comments metrics (optional, for popularity or weighting sentiment)

    Challenges/Considerations:

        Dynamic content: Some sites load content dynamically (requires Selenium to render/scroll).

        Rate limits/anti-scraping: Use polite scraping intervals or an API if the site provides one.

        Storage: Store text data for further sentiment analysis.

2. Data Processing
2.1 Cleaning and Normalizing

    Remove HTML tags, emojis, or special characters from scraped text using libraries like re (regular expressions) or built-in string methods.

    Store cleaned text in a structured format (pandas DataFrame or a database table).

2.2 Sentiment Analysis (Optional First Pass)

    Rule-based: Simple approach counting positive/negative words (e.g., using a word list).

    NLP Library: Use Python packages like TextBlob or NLTK to get a quick sentiment score (polarity, subjectivity).

    Advanced Models: Integrate more modern libraries (e.g., spaCy or transformers-based models) for higher accuracy.

If you only need a basic “positive/negative/neutral” classification, a simple model can suffice. For more advanced analysis, consider fine-tuning a transformer-based model.
3. Integrating Price & Sentiment
3.1 Data Merging

    Create a common time index (e.g., hourly) to merge your price data and aggregated sentiment scores.

    If you’re scraping multiple sites, aggregate sentiment by coin and time window (e.g., average sentiment per hour).

3.2 Calculating Sentiment Metrics

    Mention Volume: Count how many posts mention a specific coin over a given timeframe.

    Average Sentiment Score: Aggregate sentiment scores for that timeframe.

    Weighted Scores (optional): Weigh by upvotes or user karma to emphasize popular posts.

3.3 Alerts/Triggers (Optional)

    Implement a simple threshold-based alert system. For example:

        If price changes more than ±5% within 24 hours, send an alert.

        If sentiment volume spikes above a certain threshold (e.g., 2x the daily average), send an alert.

4. Visualization and Reporting
4.1 Charts and Dashboards

    Use Plotly or Matplotlib to create:

        Price Chart over time for each coin.

        Overlay Sentiment on the price chart (e.g., a second y-axis for sentiment).

    Interactive Dashboards:

        Tools like Streamlit, Dash, or Flask can turn your data into a web app.

        Display data tables, charts, and real-time updates.

4.2 Example Python Chart (Matplotlib)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_price_and_sentiment(time_data, price_data, sentiment_data, coin):
    plt.figure()
    plt.plot(time_data, price_data, label='Price')
    plt.plot(time_data, sentiment_data, label='Sentiment')
    plt.title(f'{coin} Price vs. Sentiment Over Time')
    plt.xlabel('Time')
    plt.ylabel('Value / Sentiment')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

5. Future Upgrades

    Advanced Sentiment NLP: Incorporate more sophisticated models or use third-party NLP services for better accuracy.

    Portfolio Tracking: Let users input the amount of each coin they hold, and track overall portfolio value.

    Predictive Analytics:

        Build or integrate forecast models that use historical price and sentiment data.

        Could include machine learning/regression or time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).

    Mobile App Integration: Create a companion app with push notifications for large price swings or sentiment anomalies.

    Extended Social Listening:

        Include Discord/Telegram channels (common for crypto communities).

        Possibly use official APIs or specialized scraping libraries.
